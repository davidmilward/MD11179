\begin{abstract}
n this paper we present an ISO11179 metadata registry using a data-oriented Domain Specific Modelling Language(DSML). In particular we examine how certain aspects of the ISO11179 specification can be strengthened by using a specific DSML built to handle interoperability use cases, and also how using a model based engineering framework addresses ambiguities in the standard. We examine how the DSML approach taken in this paper presents a concrete realisation of data componentisation, harmonisation, standardisation and reuse of meta-data components. We also examine how the ISO11179 based DSML can be implemented using the Eclipse Modelling Framework and made interoperable with UML In particular, we identify how Model Driven Engineering has helped in achieving the specific goals of ISO11179 via a case study.

\section{Introduction}

ISO11179 is the ISO standard for metadata registries. Metadata registries are used in many organisations to carry out a number of functions, nearly all of them are related to the need to ensure that data is used consistently within an organization.  The need for such a toolkit has become apparent in the last 10 years or so as the amount of data available to organizations has exploded, and despite the existence of an international standard metadata registries are implemented in a variety of different ways. In this paper we look at the intentions of the standard, and since there is no reference implementation of the standard we attempt to build an ISO11179 metadata registry using model driven engineering principles. During this process we examine the strengths and weaknesses of the standard and highlight areas in which the standard can be strengthened, made more user-friendly, adaptable and workable within an enterprise architectural framework. 


\section{Backgound}

\subsection{Model Based Engineering}
Model Based Engineering or Model Driven Engineering is the software engineering practise which utilises \emph{Models} as first class entities in analysing and designing a solution, code is then directly generated from the model. Ideally a situation is achieved whereby a complete round-trip is possible from the model to the code, and then from the code back to exactly the same model; in practise this is not always achieved, however considerable gains in code generation and prototyping, that make the modelling process worthwhile.

The overall architecture is often broken down by considering abstraction layers, which are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:mbe1}
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth,natwidth=610,natheight=642]{Models1}
\caption{Abstraction Layers in Model Based Engineering} 
\label{fig:mbe1}
\end{figure}
We can see that UML itself sits at what is refered to as the M2 level in this architecture model. Each abstraction layer is defined so that the level \emph{below} can be seen as being an implementation of that layer; in this way the UML model is one implementation out of many possible implementations of the UML language. The UML Language itself is an implementation of the MOF meta-meta-language which resides at the M3 layer. It is possible to use UML to define other meta-models at the M2 level, one could for instance use a sub-set of UML to define just a data language at this level.

When one builds a model for a system using MBE the model is normally at the same level of abstraction as the program.  So one would expect that a model which is built to represent an artefact, say a conference registration system to be built at level M!, and one would also expect there to be a direct one-to-one relationship between the model and the program itself. A Java or C\# program therefore would sit at the M1 level, and would be related directly to a model existing at that level.

\subsubsection{Domain Specific Languages}
Sometime the term \emph{Domain Specific Language(DSL)} is used to talk about a language which has been built purely to be used within one narrow domain of usage. An example here would be the language \emph{Gradle} which has been built to solve the problem of managing software development projects, and uses as first class citizens the nouns and verbs of the software development process, such as \emph{clean, run, process, etc}. It allows a domain expert to write a build process from scratch without having to know how to do a lot of the detailed work in the programming language. Gradle is written in Groovy, and compiles to the JVM, however it used by software developers developing in both JVM and non-JVM languages alike.

The term DSL is general covering two main aspects of software analysis and design, the first is the modelling of the domain and the second is engineering an efficient programming language to express these models. Whilst these two aspects are often merged, for the sake of clarity we differentiate here, and take the layered approach taken by Latry et al~cite{latry2006processing}.
 

\subsubsection{Domain Specific Modelling Language}

A Domain Specific Modelling Language is one that is purely targeting the problem domain, in that it describes problems and solutions in domain terms, and provides a language which domain experts can understand and implement within their domain. In this regard we are considering the domain of managing large datasets, ontologies and classification systems, and the domain experts we are considering are those who will create and edit these datasets. 

\subsubsection{Domain Specific Programming Language}	
A Domain Specific Programming language is concerned with how to implement a suitable language using a general purpose programming language(GPL), frameworks, aspects, etc. There are no real rules to developing a DSPL, and it maybe that developing a DSPL is simply a stage in the development of the DSL, or it may be a module within the DSL,

\subsection{ISO11179}

The ISO11179 Standard for metadata registries defines its purpose (ISO11179-1 section 0.2 General description of ISO/IEC 11179)as follows,
\newline
to promote:
\begin{itemize}
\item Standard description of data
\item Common understanding of data across organizational elements and between organizations
\item Re-use and standardization of data over time, space, and applications
\item Harmonization and standardization of data within an organization and across organizations
\item Management of the components \emph{of descriptions} of data
\item Re-use of the components \emph{of descriptions} of data.
\end{itemize}

Interoperability isn't specifically mentioned, however these six goals are very close to being a description of framework for interoperability for data and data components through the use of \emph{metadata}. There is no other international standard which specifically tackles interoperability, although there are a number of accepted maturity models which address interoperability issues(NIEM, ECInterop) within the enterprise.  The MDI model framework which emerged from the Athena and Interop NoE (INTEROP, Athena) research projects have made progress in defining ways of implementing interoperability using model driven engineering concepts and ideas, and since ISO11179 is currently in use in both the Healthcare and Defence sectors we examine the core purposes of the standard to try and determine how we it achieves these purposes. We implement an ISO11179 conformant metadata registry using Model Based Engineering principles, and examine how use of these principles have helped achieved the purposes of ISO11179. 


\subsubsection{Standard Data Description}

The standard data description in ISO11179 is given in section1.6.1 where the idea of a data element is introduced, and with it the idea that it is composed of two parts, its conceptual part and its representational part. This section further puts forward the notion that a data element concept can be composed of two parts, an object class and a property. An object class is said to correspond with a class (in OO terms) or an entity(in ER terms). This is further illustrated with the illustration copied fro the ISO11179 documentation below in figure~\ref{fig:DEC}:

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth,natwidth=610,natheight=642]{DataElementConcept}
\caption{Data Elements and Data Element Concepts} 
\label{fig:DEC}
\end{figure}

The standard continues to describe the relationship between data elements and the concepts associated with them, and also puts forward the notion that a data element is produced when a data element concept is associated with a representation. The notion of \emph{value domains} is introduced, where a value domain is defined as:

\begin{quotation} {sets of permissible values for data} \end{quotation}

This section then looks in detail at ways in which the conceptual aspects of data elements and value domains are related, and during these discussions the a fundamental model of value domains is presented. Other concepts such as measurement units and enumerations are used to further define the role of the value domain within the standard. Section 1.6 discusses aspects of classification of data elements, apart from the previously introduced notions of object class and property which are part of the Data Element Concept idea. An overview of a metadata registry is introduced in section 1.7, the main feature being that it is a database for metadata built along the lines of the conceptual model provided in section 3 of the standard. Section 1.8 covers the rest of the standard, in addition there is a detailed treatment of terminological principles in the appendix.


\subsubsection{Common understanding of Data}

Part 4 of the standard details how to formulate good data definitions, and data definitions are one of the key aspects to achieving a common understanding. The advice in this part of the standard can be summarised as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
\item State the essential meaning of the concept
\item Be precise and unambiguous
\item Be concise
\item Be able to stand alone
\item Be expressed without embedding rationale, functional usage, domain information, or procedural information.
\item Avoid circular reasoning
\item Use the same terminology and consistent logical structure for related definitions
\item Be appropriate for the type of metadata being defined.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Re-use and Standardization of Data over time, space and applications}

According to section 5 Standardization involves standardizing the descriptive data itself: characteristics, property values of characteristics, selection of signifiers, and the meaning of values.  It can occur at a variety of levels: agency, national , regional, or international. Governance is further applied by accredited standards organizations, who may well have their own standardization processes. ISO11179-5 details key aspects of naming which should be part of any naming system for data items contained in a registry, and lists a number of criteria which a conforming registry should adhere to. It doesn't prescribe any particular naming system, but rather the key qualities that a naming system should have, and which a registry should document. Part 6 details the organizational requirements for running and administering a metadata registry, however it doesn't specify how re-use or standardization of data over time, space and applications will be enhanced by using an ISO11179 conformant metadata registry. By applying a naming convention to metadata, and by enforcing a rigorous application of that naming convention we can standardise data, however there are no clear practical indications of how this is to be done in the standard.

\subsubsection{Harmonization and Standardization of data}

This follows on from the previous goals listed in the standard, and there is little doubt that having the ability to compare data elements from different classification systems will greatly help in harmonizing datasets.

\subsubsection{Management of the components \emph{of descriptions} of data}

Here the standard has changed in that the last iteration of the standard has changed the purpose from \emph'{Management of the components of data} to \emph'{Management of the components of descriptions of data}. Most computer scientists would read this as being a change from the idea of \emph{object} to \emph{class}, since an object can be seen as being a component of data, and a class as being a component of a description of data. We consider the term \emph{metadata components} or \emph{models} to be more fitting. Although the management of data components or metadata components is talked about within the standard, it is very often in the terms of the meta-model behind the standard, ideas such as \emph{arranging semantic components with a naming convention} (ISO11179-5.p6) are discussed, but with almost no reference to actual details of what a semantic component is, whether it is referring to combination of a data element and data element concept or an object running in an object oriented programming language. In our view the management models or metadata components is not really addressed by the standard, and it really needs to be.

\subsubsection{Re-use of the components of descriptions of data}

As with the previous discussion we fail to see any direct way in which the standard supports this avowed purpose except indirectly. There is no real definition on what is being referred to by descriptions of data, except in the discussions over what is metadata, when it appears that metadata is defined as being ``'descriptions of data'. This being the case it begs the question of why this purpose is using the terminology \emph{descriptions of data} instead of \emph{metadata}. 

\subsection{Design of an ISO11179 Metadata Registry}

ISO11179-3 has a detailed account of the registry metamodel and its attributes, and sets out to be relevent to application designers, system architects, and software developers. It uses UML 2.4.1 as a modelling language to describe the main features of a conformant metadata registry, although the standard itself is quite clear in not endorsing any particular environment, database management system, database design paradigm, system development methodology, data definition language, command language, system interface, user interface, computing platform or technology required for implementation. However in ISO11179-3.5 a metamodel is used to describe the information model of a metadata registry, and again the standard is clear that this should not limit the actual implementation technology used. The UML description is split into a number of packages:
\begin{itemize}
\item Basic Package
\item Identification Metamodel
\item Designation and Definition Metamodel
\item Registration Package
\item Concepts Package (Concepts and Classification regions)
\item Binary Relations Package
\item Data Descriptions Package
\end{itemize}
Metadata items are constrained by a set of rules which are described as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Rule 1 : A metadata item is  \emph{identified} if has one or more identification associations each with a \emph{Scoped\_Identifier} class.
\item Rule 2 : A metadata item is  \emph{designated} if it has one or more item\_designation associations each with a \emph{Designation} class
\item Rule 3 : A metadata item is \emph{defined} if it has one or more item\_definition associations each with a \emph{Definition} class
\item Rule 4 : A metadata item is \emph{classified} if it has one or more Classification association classes, each with a concept class in a Concept\_System.
\item Rule 5 : A metadata item is  \emph{registered} if it has one or more \emph{submission} associations, each with a Submission\_record class.
\item Rule 6 :  A metadata item is  \emph{administered} if it has exactly one stewardship association with a Stewardship\_Record class - only applies where rule 7 does not apply
\item Rule 7 : A metadata item is \emph{attached} if it has exactly one attachment association with an Administered\_Item class - can only apply in cases where rule 6 does not.
\end{itemize}

The standard continues to provide a detailed account of how metadata items are related within the metadata registry, for the purposes of brevity we will not repeat them all here, but we may refer back to specific parts of the standard where required.



\section{A DSML for ISO11179}

In order to look at the ISO11179 standard from a modelling perspective we need to see how the current normative description and UML diagrams, which make up the ISO11179 model, fit into a MBE architecture.  shows the standard view of abstractions from an MBE viewpoint:




In FIgure~\ref{fig:mbe1}  we can see that UML itself sits at what is refered to as the M2 level in this architecture model. Each abstraction layer is defined so that the level \emph{below} can be seen as being an implementation of that layer; in this way the UML model is an implementation of the UML language, which in turn is am implementation of the MOF meta-meta-language which resides at the M3 layer. It is possible to use UML to define meta-models at the M2 level, and this is what is being done here by using UML and text to describe the ISO11179 Model in ISO11179-3. 

The model description in the ISO11179 also defines aspects of the implementation, and no particular regard has been made to differentiating between aspects of the MDR itself, and the groups of metadata which it is holding. In reference to Figure~\ref{fig:mbe1} it is not clear which items belong at M2 and which at M1levels. This makes it quite difficult to implement since it is not always clear from the standard which diagrams pertain to implementation details and which pertain to the core model. In parts of the standard implementation details are deliberately avoided, and in orthers they are clearly indicated. For instance is it necessary to instantiate a class of \emph{Value Domain} objects within the registry, or is it sufficient to represent this aspect of a data element using other properties of a data element.

We have taken the appoach that if we can define the M2 layer, then building the M1 will be straightforward using standard model based engineering techniques. This approach still leaves the implementation details as details which can be adjusted for any particular environment, we can use different code generators on different platforms to generate different implementations of a metadata registry, but still keeping to the original standard.


\subsection{Language Definition}

The metamodel given is informed by experience with Healthcare information systems \cite{DSMCR} and by the development of an open source Metadata Registry built around similar principles. The DSML has been built to help with data curation and creation in the Healthcare domain, and as such is the result of discussion with domain experts in this sector.  It was not designed with ISO11179  in mind, however it is achieving in practise many of the aims of ISO11179. 


The reason for designing this DSML  is that we seek a meta-language to be able handle hetrogeneous metadata stored using a variety of languages. It needs to be able to capture metadata, in particular a detailed description the data is stored in relational databases, XML Schemas, XML files based on XML Schemas, Excel files and object-oriented programs. It then needs to be able to automatically transform the data into a number of simple formats. To do this each dataset at an M1 level needs to be described at the M2 level, by doing this we can build a container which can hold the metadata collected at the M1 level.

The core entities in the metamodel are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item DataModel
\item DataClass
\item DataItem
\item DataType
\item DataConstraint
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth,natwidth=610,natheight=642]{LemmaCore1}
\caption{Core Metamodel (Lemma)} 
\label{fig:lemma}
\end{figure}

This metamodel forms a language in its own right which is able to describe the structure of data, it doesn't deal with behaviour so there are few operations in this language.

The language is a language of \emph{metadata} and it will normally sit within the context of a metadata registry or similar server artefact. The core entity in our new model is the \emph{ConceptElement} which is in effect an abstract entities from which most of the other entities derive, it handles the versioning control through the use of a GUID, which has the added benfit of turning metadata into \emph{linked metadata} automatically. The ConceptElement together with the \emph{Relationship} entity is able to define relationships between any of its sub-entities. The Tag class allows any vocabulary or ontology element to be associated with any catalogue element. This we will see later on will enable the import of standard ontologies into a metadata registry built around this metamodel.

\subsubsection{DataModel}
A DataModel is a versioning and grouping mechanism for one metadata-set, it might for instance be metadata connected with a particular database, or a particular XSD Schema which is used in a particular domain, however it allows us to group and version a related set of DataClasses.  A DataModel can contain many DataElements, and many DataTypes. A DataModel contains one or more DataItems, which may be implemented as DataClasses, DataElements, DataTypes or EnumerationValues. As all DataItems are also AbstractItems, they can have Tags, which link them to entities outside that DataModel using URI's, and they can have Relationships which are two-way associations with other AbstractItems. DataConstraints are attached to each DataModel and are applicable within that DataModel.

\subsubsection{DataClass}
 A DataClass is a mechanism for grouping DataItems, which are atomic pieces of data. A concept may be represented by a class, but the DataItem is the atomic component of that class, it can't be reduced into any smaller component. A DataClass can be used as a DataItem, in that it can be contained within another DataClass, and so it can be used to provide multi-level grouping within a DataModel. A DataClass can \emph{extend} another DataClass, this \emph{inheritance} mechanism is very straightforward, it allows the child class to have all the member DataItems and DataClasses that are present in the parent. These DataItems and DataClasses are in effect references, so that if the parent class changes then these \emph{inherited} DataItems and DataClasses will be changed as well.
 
 \subsubsection{DataElement}
 A DataElement is the smallest data entity described in this langauge, it has a direct one to one relationship with a DataType, since every DataElement will have a corresponding DataType. 
 
 \subsubsection{DataType}
 A DataType is a basic type or value representation for a particular DataItem, it represents the kind of unit of the DataItem, for instance for it could be a set of values defined by a enumerations, or it could be a number represented by an integer or double DataType. The notion of DataType here is very similar to that which prevails in the Computer Science world and is defined by Pierce ~\cite{Pierce} as follows:
\textbf{A type system is a tractable synthetic method for proving the absence of certain program behaviours by classifying phrases according to the kinds of values they compute}. 

We use this modelling language to define metamodels, which are housed in the metadata registry, each metamodel being the description of a data-item or a group of data-items. In the next section we explain how this language satisfies the metamodel described in ISO11179-3.



\section{Implementation of the Metadata Registry}

In implementing a metadata registry based on the standard we need to separate which parts of the specification deal with a metadata registry, and which parts specify the metadata which is registered in the registry. ISO11179:3 is split into several sections, sections 1 - 4 consist of an introduction, references, terminology and conformance details, for the purposes of implementing the MDR we need the following sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item Section 5 : Structure of a Metadata Registry
\item Section 6 : Basic Package : common datatypes and classes
\item Section 7 : Identification, Designation and Definition Package
\item Section 8 : Registration Package
\item Section 9 : Concepts Package
\item Section 10 : Binary Relations Package
\item Section 11 : Data Descriptions Package
\end{itemize}
